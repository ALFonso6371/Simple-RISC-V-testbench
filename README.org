* Simple-RISC-V-testbench
A public testbench for RISC-V design (MR329).
** How to use?
This is an automatic testbench for the course design of MR329
(Computer Architecture). It use the GitHub Action as the test
environment and compare your HDL source files' simulation result with
an emulator written in C.

To use this testbench:
   1. Fork this repository.
   2. Clone this repository to your machine and modify the files
      single/riscv_soc_tb.v and pipeline/riscv_soc_tb.v
      1.
      #+BEGIN_SRC verilog
         for (i = 0; i <= 1023; i = i+1) begin
            $fwrite(handle, "%h\n", riscv_soc_tb.data_mem0.data[i]); // change the riscv_soc_tb.data_mem0.data[i] to the instance of your data memory
         end
      #+END_SRC

      2.
      #+BEGIN_SRC verilog
      for (i = 1; i <= 31; i = i+1) begin
         $fwrite(handle, "%h\n", riscv_soc_tb.riscv0.RF.register_file[i]); // change the riscv_soc_tb.riscv0.RF.register_file[i] to the instance of your register file
      end
      #+END_SRC
   3. Move your source file to single/ and pipeline/
   4. Commit, push and wait for the result.
